# BadUSB-Playground
Welcome to the BadUSB Playground, let's build some cool stuff!
Most of what you find in here is either a WIP or resources for a project.
If you are just looking for ducky scripts head over to my [BadUSB repo](https://github.com/FalsePhilosopher/badusb).<br>

# Contributing
## Please adhere to the following best practices and style guides when submitting a payload.

## Naming Conventions
Please give your payload a unique, descriptive and appropriate name. Do not use spaces in payload, directory or file names. Each payload should be submit into its own directory, with `-` or `_` used in place of spaces, to one of the categories such as exfiltration, phishing, remote_access or recon. Do not create your own category.
