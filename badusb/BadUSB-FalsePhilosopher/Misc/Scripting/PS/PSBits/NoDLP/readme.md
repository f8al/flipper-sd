Sometimes you need to transfer your files over the proxy/DLP/gateway etc. And they do not like some files, especially .exe and .dll

I bypassed such protection multiple times with Base64, but then realized some DLPs look at the text trying to asses the string entropy, finding common english words etc.
So I have created new pair of scripts, describing the arbitrary file in a nicer way, totally "safe" for all those peeking inside.

Feel free to use. It is kind of PoC, but it works nicely.
