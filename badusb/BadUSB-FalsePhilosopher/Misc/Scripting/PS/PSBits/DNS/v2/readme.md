Yet another dropper. And yet another DNS based. <p>
What is interesting (for me as an author) is pure cmd + nslookup + certutil approach. 100% LOLBin, 0% PowerShell, and what's even more interesting, it's nslookup transfering the data, and certutil works only as decoder.
<p>
The simple PowerShell script is used to create records on the Windows DNS server. It may be slightly easier than using the DNS server written from scratch in Delphi, as I did in some time ago...

Have fun!
