An app exporting reg keys in the ready-to-import .reg format. Import will happen into the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\BetterRegExport though.<p>
Why it's better?
  1. reads registry files directly thus ignoring ACLs
  1. adds comments to the .reg file, especially about key last write time and original SDDL
