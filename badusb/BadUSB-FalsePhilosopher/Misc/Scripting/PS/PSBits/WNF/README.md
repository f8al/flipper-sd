Simple WNF monitor using callback to display WNF_SHEL_APPLICATION_STARTED messages.
Uncoment #define fullset (line 25) to monitor WNF_SHEL_DESKTOP_APPLICATION_STARTED, WNF_SHEL_DESKTOP_APPLICATION_TERMINATED, and WNF_SHEL_APPLICATION_TERMINATED as well.

Not sure if it is really useful, but I wanted to observe paths reported, as their format with well-known-folders GUIDs looked a bit strange for me.
And now I am just sharing.

No special privileges required.
