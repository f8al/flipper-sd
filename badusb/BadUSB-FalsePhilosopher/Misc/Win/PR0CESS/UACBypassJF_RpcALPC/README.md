# UAC Bypass 

This amazing trick by James Forshaw was released in 2019 [Project Zero - Calling Local Windows RPC Servers from .NET](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/12/calling-local-windows-rpc-servers-from.html) allow you to bypass UAC using only 2 RPC requests instead of DLL hijack. Basically rewritten from [hfiref0x/UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME).

Tested works well on Windows 11 :)
