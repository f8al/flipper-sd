# BSOD Machine
BSOD Machine is a C# program to BSOD the system. This takes advantage of 2 undocumented NT API method that working together, raises a BSOD with an error code.

This does NOT require administrator permissions to BSOD the system, this function has existed since atleast Windows XP (AFAIK).  
This program may not work depending on the security policies set up on the computer.

do not question what I do when bored
