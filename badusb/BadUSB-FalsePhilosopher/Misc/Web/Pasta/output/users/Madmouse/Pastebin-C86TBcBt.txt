politeness

count negative statements by a weight table, checking for racist slang, rude language,
and personal equivalence which I will define later and keep simple now.

rudeness = Word count * phrase weight

for example:
phrase_type =
[
    racist     = 10
    sexual     = 8
    personal   = 5
    gross      = 2
]

"My you are a hideous pile of shit."
              * personal      * gross
word count = 2
word weight = personal + gross = 7
result = wc * ww = 14

"Your mother likes to suck niggers  cocks in the parking lot"
      * personal           * racist * sexual

word count = 3
word weight = personal + racist + sexual = 23
result = wc * ww = 69
