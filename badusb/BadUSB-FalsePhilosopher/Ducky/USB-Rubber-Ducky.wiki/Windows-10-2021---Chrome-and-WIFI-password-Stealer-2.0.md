Carbziesss's Modified Version of nejcpirecnik's Chrome-Artemis to work offline and steal network keys with TwinDuck Firmware
Use for Educational purposes only I am not liable for anything stupid or illegal you do.

This is my modified version of nejcpirecnik's Chrome-Artemis it works offline by using TwinDuck firmware to copy necessary dependencies from the sd card storage of the Ducky and then saves the information it gathers back onto the rubber ducky  and it now gets wifi passwords as well

I will attach a zip file of everything on MY twinduck for reference or you can just flat out copy and paste everything from the zip onto your twinduck and only change drive letters in the Inject file and the Recon.ps1
Have fun
