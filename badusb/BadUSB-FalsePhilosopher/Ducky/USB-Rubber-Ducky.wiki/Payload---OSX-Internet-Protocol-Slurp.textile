REM Title: OSX Internet Protocol Slurp
REM Author: Cameron Glass
REM Description: This payload quickly copies down information gathered from terminals command ifconfig and pastes it in a file called "default_config" (So there is no suspicion) in the Documents folder. This payload also quickly cleans up after itself allowing for a 10 second stealth slurp. If need be you may change the command "ifconfig" to any other command such as "ls" or others.
