Simple script that downloads any file and runs it
Note: you must put in your own specific code to execute here:
<INSERT COMMAND TO EXECUTE HERE>

Note: This script doesn't delete the downloaded file so it may leave evidence of physical access.  
Delete it as quickly as possible after this runs.
Or alternatively you could hide it somewhere in a hidden folder where it won't be easily found.
