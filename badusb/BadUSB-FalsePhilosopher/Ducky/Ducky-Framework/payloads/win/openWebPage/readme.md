Target: Any platform that supports Alt+F2, Command+Space, or Control+R.
Description: A simple script that opens a webpage. 
It's based on Hak5 2124, but it presses Command+Space 3 times, 
because on Windows it changes the keyboard layout, and it has 3 options. 
Make sure to change the firmware as in the original video on Macs to avoid the pop-up about the layout.
