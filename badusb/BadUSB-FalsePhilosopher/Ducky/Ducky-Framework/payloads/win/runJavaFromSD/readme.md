The following is another payload for running applications on Twin duck firmware from off your SD card automatically. 
This payload waits for the ducky drive to mount, 
then switches to the directory containing the Java payload, then launches the payload. 
I don't know how useful this will be, but it is here if you need it. 
This only runs on Windows systems, but should run on all current Windows thanks to some code written by googleknowsbest. 
Change <JavaApp> to the name of your application.
