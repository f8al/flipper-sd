Target OS: Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit), maybe older/newer windows versions. Haven't tested it on any other than 7.
Description: Plays off of Aprizm's script to open a website, 
but it also disables the mouse and keyboard so the user can't leave the website.
Info:
The user can easily unplug and re-plug in the keyboard/mouse to reinstall the drivers get them working again. 
This requires the user to plug a USB drive in BEFORE the ducky is plugged in.
