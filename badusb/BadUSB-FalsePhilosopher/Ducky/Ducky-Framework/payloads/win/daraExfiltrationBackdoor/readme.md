This simple script will grab all of the wifi passwords, external IP address, 
LAN address, and hostname of the target device and e-mail it to an address of your choice.
I recommend you use a Gmail address for this. 
I have not had luck with Yahoo, Hotmail, etc...
It then creates a user called Microsoft, and shares C:\ out to the new user. 
My goal here was to use one liners to prevent this from being picked up by whitelisting applications 
(no .bat, .exe, etc...)
