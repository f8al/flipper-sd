A ducky script that uses the powershell to download and execute a file from a webserver,
then close all powershell windows (with another powershell). 
Intended for use with windows 10 target, but probably works with Windows 7 and 8.
  !!!Change the link and what name to save the file as.!!!
Execution time: 5-8 seconds (delays will need to be modified based on target machine speed)
