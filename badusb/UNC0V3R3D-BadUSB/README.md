## Usage example

To begin using the scripts, ``please carefully read`` the "readme.md" file provided with each script. This file contains ``important information`` on how to use the script safely. Keep in mind that some scripts may ``potentially harm your system``, so be cautious and do not run unfamiliar scripts on your personal computer. To test scripts, it is recommended to ``use a virtual machine`` for safety.

## Explanation of the files

Before using the files on your Flipper, it is important to thoroughly understand them. While the majority of the files in my BadUsb repository are relatively harmless, there are some that may potentially cause serious damage. It is important to exercise caution when using these files.

<h3> Understanding DuckyScript </h3>

* All BadUsb-Scripts are written in the ``DuckyScript 1.0`` language.
* The language is kind of ``easy`` to understand and to learn.
* If you really want to look further into this please refer to this [Documentation].
* The kind of ``hard part`` are the PowerShell scripts.
* We use PowerShell or PowerShell scripts in ``97%`` of all DuckyScripts.
* PowerShell or PowerShell scripts give us ``full power`` over the machine.
* If you want to learn how to write PowerShell scripts after learning the DuckyScript basics please refer to this [PowerShell-Guide].
* In BadUsb scripts, you will most likely find comments every few lines, that start with the command ``REM`` at the beginning.
* Those comments often ``explain the whole process`` and help you a lot.
* That's how you understand certain BadUsb scripts, but you can also often already identify the script by its file name.

<h3> Using the scripts properly </h3>

* So now that we have prepared everything, we can start to test our first script!
* We are going to run the first script on our ``own`` PC.
* Of course, you don't want to cause damage to your PC, so we are going to choose a harmless script.
* Let's choose a script that will draw something in the Notepad.
* I chose a [script] from my ASCII repository.
* If you want to open the text file on your phone or pc to see what is inside feel free to do so.
* To start you are going to start the Flipper and find the ``BadUSB`` category.
* There you will see all the scripts you have imported from your PC or phone.
* Now choose a harmless script and wait until the Flipper tells you to connect to a PC via the USB cable.
* Just press the middle button to start the script.
* Now the script should open Notepad and write a simple sentence "Hacked by UNC0V3R3D".
* If you succeeded congrats! You have just run your very first script.
* If something went wrong then please scroll further down to see the ``Troubleshooting section`` and follow the steps.

<h3> Troubleshooting Problems </h3>

First of all, you have to identify the problem. Then you can look at the list below and maybe you will recognize your problem.

* ``1.0`` <b> The script open random things and typed the text somewhere, where it shouldn't be. </b>
  * <em> So this is often caused by ``too short delays`` between the commands. In the BadUsb script file, you should see some commands, that start with ``DELAY``
       and then there is a number behind it. ``Example: DELAY 500``. The number stands for ``milliseconds``. Changing the delay to a ``higher number`` than the current number should solve the problem ``(DELAY 500 --> DELAY 700)`` </em>
       
* ``1.1`` <b> The Flipper shows an error like this: ``ERROR: line 5`` </b>
  * <em> If the Flipper prints random errors like this you should check the ``text file``. The most common thing causing this error is apparently a ``random blank line``
  between the commands. Otherwise, make sure there is no line containing the ``"LOCALE .."`` command. It doesn't properly work on the Flipper, yeah I do not know why that is. If there is still an error, look at the line where the error is coming from and make sure there is no ``space`` at the beginning of the line. </em>
  
* ``1.3`` <b> The Flipper shows an random overlayed error in line 1 </b>
  * <em> This is a new error/bug in the official firmware! To get around this error you will need to install an older version of the official firmware or switch to a third-party firmware like "Rogue Master". </em>

* I hope that you find a a solution for your problem. If you need help feel free to always contact me via Discord or Email.
